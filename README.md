# Survey-desgin-Attitudes-to-Plan-B-Covid-19-Restrictions
This report aims to provide an appropriate final survey that captures the UK’s public view on Plan B restrictions. The data from the final survey proposed could be vital for the government to combat Covid-19, economic, social, health and other related issues. (Grade 68%)

# Introduction
On December 1st, 2021, allegations of a 2020 Downing Street Christmas party emerged, leading the Labour Party to overtake the Conservatives in the opinion polls. On December 9th, 2021, the government announced its Plan B strategy that re-introduced several Covid-19 restrictions to combat the rise of the new Omicron variant. Due to the government’s misdemeanours, critics viewed Plan B as a “dead cat” strategy, and the introduction of Covid passes have generated various debates as to whether these were appropriate.

Consequently, this report aims to provide an appropriate final survey that captures the UK’s public view on Plan B restrictions. The data from the final survey proposed could be vital for the government to combat Covid-19, economic, social, health and other related issues.
Section 1.0 describes the cognitive interviewing (CI) method, process, results and recommendations for the pilot survey (PS). Section 2.0 explains the steps taken to validate key survey items and utilises the PS designed from Section 1.0. Section 3.0 appraises recommendations for the final survey item wording and parameters. Lastly, section 4.0 exhibits the bibliography, Appendix A (ethical approval and consent forms), Appendix B (CI), and Appendix C (PS).

# Section 1.0
1.1. Cognitive Interview Method and Process

The first question (Appendix B) was asked in the CI to understand the public’s view on the Plan B re- strictions. This first question was decided upon as it is not a double-barrelled question, is unbiased and avoids complex and unfamiliar terms. Thus, in theory, the question should be straightforward to answer and accessible to most.

A CI was utilised to pre-test the first question (Appendix B) and determine if or how it should be modified prior to survey fielding to make it easier to answer and see whether the wording works as expected. The CI conducted was semi-structured and contained both closed and open-ended questions. Halperin (2017) asserts that one benefit of semi-structured interviews is that they provide more valid data as they give greater insight into the meanings of a subject’s experiences. The first question is a closed-ended question that utilises an interval survey scale to measure variables, thus quantifying the difference in value between the two variables (support or oppose). Therefore, making the first question easy for respondents to answer, thus minimising measurement error. The interview then employs open-ended questions and probes (Appendix B) that follow Tourangeau’s (1984) Survey Response Model to clarify the response processes four stages testing the reliability and highlighting the main themes. The second question tests the comprehension, the third question retrieval, the fourth judgment, and the fifth the respondents’ response. Consequently, the CI determines how well respondents understand the questions and formulate their responses.
Lavrakas (2008) asserts that the CI sample size should be small as the main goal is the timely development and evaluation of survey questions and not the data collection. Hence, the CI used convenience sampling to select three participates for interviewing. Moreover, the process follows the Central Research Ethics Advisory Group criteria (Appendix A) to protect participants’ dignity, rights, safety, and well-being. The participants were required to read and approve a consent form (Appendix A) that ensured consent and confidentiality.

The CI was an online interview conducted via Google forms. The responses of the closed and open-ended questions were coded (Appendix B/C for codebooks) for a more straightforward analysis of variables and themes.

1.5. Comprehension

From the CI four-stage response process, two main themes emerged when respondents were asked to re- port what “Covid-19 restrictions” means are protection/safety (mentioned by 2/3 of respondents) and free- dom (mentioned by 1/3 of respondents). Individuals that interpreted the question as being about protec- tion/safety mentioned that restrictions such as lockdown, social distancing and facemasks protect others and are a viable way to stop Covid-19. Individuals that interpreted the question as being about freedom mentioned how restrictions have reduced freedom and negatively impacted their lives and other peoples’ livelihoods.

1.6. Retrieval

All respondents offered detailed accounts of the calculations that provided the answer. All respondents elaborated and outlined processes of recollection of experiences (working from home, facemasks, social dis- tancing, lockdowns). All respondents gave a comprehensive and balanced argument about why they came to their answer. For instance, one respondent claimed the question to be quite hard to answer as they could see the pros and cons of restrictions. In comparison, the other two respondents found the question easy to an- swer while maintaining a balanced argument. All respondents found the response categories comprehensive enough to express their opinion on the subject.

1.7. Recommendations

Based on the results from the CI on the survey item, the wording of the question should be changed. Though there is an agreement on the meaning of this question, the question is too broad as no respondent focuses on the Plan B restrictions but rather past or potential future restrictions. Therefore, the question wording will be changed to include Plan B restrictions (Appendix C).

2.4. Correlational Validity

It is critical to test the validity of the new question fielded in the PS to see if the survey item is related to the underlying construct. A theoretical correlate is employed to test the construct validity of the survey item. The question (Appendix C) correlates with Aidan Connaughton’s (2021) findings that those on the ideological right favour fewer restrictions in advanced economies. Therefore, the two variables Qvote_REC (political ideology) and Qres_REC (support for restrictions) should theoretically correlate. Hence, if the survey item is valid, there should be a statistically significant correlation between the two variables. The association between the two variables is explored in table 3 and figure 5 below.

Table 3 shows that when Qvote_REC has higher values, Qres_REC also has higher values. Furthermore, figure 5 illustrates a positive association: the more the ideology is to the left, the more support for restrictions. Nevertheless, table 3 and figure 5 do not formally evaluate the relationship between the two variables. Hence, regression analysis is utilised to test the strength and statistical significance of the association between two variables.

<img width="360" alt="Screenshot 2022-02-11 at 15 45 30" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97530878/153622616-f794c9a5-7127-43f6-bb75-3bcf89e3169f.png">

<img width="428" alt="Screenshot 2022-02-11 at 15 45 55" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97530878/153622679-d4893c6d-2738-41fd-ba61-a9d032a1dabf.png">

If we look at table 3, when Qvote_REC has higher values, Qres_REC also has higher values. Furthermore, the scatterplot (figure 5) also clearly illustrations a positive association: the more the ideology left, the more support for Covid-19 restrictions. Nevertheless, table 3 and figure 5 do not formally evaluate the relationship between the two variables. Hence, regression analysis is utilised to test the strength and statistical significance of the association between two variables.

2.5. Correlational Validity via Formal Hypothesis Testing

<img width="489" alt="Screenshot 2022-02-11 at 15 46 47" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97530878/153622811-d0f216f8-0017-4f63-969c-8f5491bfd6ad.png">

<img width="272" alt="Screenshot 2022-02-11 at 15 47 06" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97530878/153622870-07e8889e-d43e-4052-aec6-e68d7524806a.png">

The regression model has a low p-value of 0.00357, illustrating that the correlation is statistically significant and rejects the null hypothesis. Moreover, the variable Qvote_REC appears statistically significant as the t-value was above two (3.262). Therefore, there is strong evidence that Qres_REC depends on Qvote_REC. Additionally, the coefficient is ~ 0.57 and statistically significant at the 0.001 level. Given that the two items are not measured using the same scale, the variables are standardised to analyse the magnitude of the effect. Consequently, the relationship between the two variables is statistically significant, illustrating that the first question (Appendix C) is valid.

# Section 3.0
Overall, it can be contended that wording the questions from the PS are appropriate for the final survey item. Nevertheless, it would be necessary to change the sampling method for the final survey. The PS used a non-probability sampling method (convince sampling) and had a low sample size, thus likely causing bias. An overwhelming number of those sampled were from conservative, safe seat constituencies and the youngest age group (18 to 24); thus, the PS likely has a high sampling and coverage error. Therefore, the final survey should use an unbiased probability sampling method such as stratified sampling. Utilising satisfied sampling and weighting the data would ensure that the sample is representative of the UK as a whole, thus reducing sampling error. Additionally, according to Aron (1997), increasing the sample size would increase statistical power as a larger sample size reduces the overlap between the two distributions.
